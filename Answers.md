Question-1:Explain the relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities from the above diagram.
Answer-1: "Product" and "Product_Category" are related to each other through a foreign key, specifically the "category_id" field in the "Product" table, which references the primary key (ID) of the "Product_Category" table. This connection allows each product to be associated with a specific category, containing information such as the category name, description, creation time (createdAt), modification time (updatedAt), or deletion time (deletedAt).

Question-2:How could you ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it?
Answer-2: To ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it, a reference to the "Product_Category" entity can be included in the "Product" schema. By defining the "category_id" field in the "Product" schema and setting it to be a required field, along with enforcing referential integrity with the "Product_Category" entity, it ensures that each product must have a valid category assigned to it. This helps maintain data integrity and consistency in the database.
